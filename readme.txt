The Tour Operators plugin brings live availability, bookings, digital itineraries, and other post types tour operators need to succeed.

== Description ==

LightSpeed’s LSX Tour Operator plugin is here to help you take your Tour Operator business online. 

The plugin features digital itineraries which include interactive galleries, day-by-day information, integrated maps that show a tour’s progression, information per destination, accommodation, activities and other features that will bring your tour offerings to life online. 

Its destination management features make featuring destinations super simple, and attractive to boot. We’ve also built a “Travel Style” feature so you can categorise tours by the type of experience they offer.

Detailed accommodation listings show off room facilities, image galleries, video material, reviews, interactive digital tours, special offers, team members and more.

= Works with the free LSX Theme =
We've also made a fantastic [free theme](https://www.lsdev.biz/product/lsx-wordpress-theme/) that work well with the Tour Operator plugin.

= It's free, and always will be. =
We’re firm believers in open source - that’s why we’re releasing the Tour Operators plugin for free, forever. We offer free support on the [Tour Operator support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tour-operator).
